This directory a series of Jupyter notebooks that you can use to get familiar with running SUMMA from within Jupyter notebooks using pySUMMA.

Note that if you want to preserve the changes that you make in these notebooks, then you should save them somewhere other than in the `demo` directory in your directory tree. If not, the files may be overwritten when you download them again or when you pull down the latest changes from the github repository from where you obtained these files originally.

If you are new to python and want to practice, then extensive help exists online. For example, take a look at the software carpentry python tutorial that is discussed
on the software carpentry web site at:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation

Similarly, if you are unfamiliar with the amazing power of Jupyter notebooks, you can start here: https://jupyter.org/

The notebooks in the `demo` directory assume that you already have a SUMMA executable installed. They are optimized for running SUMMA in the cloud-based computing environment provided by the [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io) project at `https://hydro.pangeo.io`. You can also use them to run SUMMA locally (i.e. on your own machine) or elsewhere, but you will undoubtedly need to make some modifications (which I will leave as an exercise for the reader).
