This directory contains the files that will be used to run the lab
exercises for the CUAHSI Virtual University Snow Hydrology course.

Note that you should not save any files in this examples directory,
as it will get overwritten when we release new files for later homework
assignments. Instead, you will want to save all your files in the directory

/home/jovyan/work

(note that "jovyan" is your username in your own cloud instance)

So, if you do open a notebook or any other file in the examples directory
and you make changes that you want to preserve, make sure you save a copy
in /home/jovyan/work.

If you are new to python and want to practice, then we recommend that you go
through the software carpentry python tutorial that is discussed
on the software carpentry web site at:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation

The directory

/home/jovyan/swc

contains the files for this tutorial, so everything is already pre-installed.

The files needed for the various homework assignments will be in the directories

/home/jovyan/homework_0
/home/jovyan/homework_1
/home/jovyan/homework_2

These directories will become available as the course progresses.
